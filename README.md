# Data-Driven Financial Analysis of Infosys Ltd. Using SQL


## Overview

This project presents an end-to-end financial analysis of Infosys Ltd. using SQL for structured data analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization. The objective was to evaluate the company’s growth, profitability, and earnings quality using real-world financial analytics techniques similar to those used by financial analysts and consulting professionals.

The project combines database querying, financial ratio analysis, and business storytelling through dashboards to simulate an analyst-style case study.


## Objectives

* Analyze multi-year financial performance of Infosys (FY2020–FY2025)
* Apply SQL for structured financial analysis
* Evaluate growth, profitability, and cost efficiency metrics
* Build an executive-level Power BI dashboard
* Convert raw data into business insights


## Dataset

The dataset includes key financial metrics compiled from publicly available sources such as annual reports and financial disclosures.

**Key Fields:**

* Year

## Key Insights & Results

This project produced several meaningful insights derived from structured SQL analysis and visual interpretation through Power BI.

### Growth Results

* Revenue increased from ~₹90K Cr in FY20 to ~₹163K Cr in FY25, reflecting strong structural growth across the analysis period.
* Revenue CAGR of 12.41% indicates sustained top-line expansion driven by digital transformation and global IT outsourcing demand.

### Profitability Results

* Net profit showed consistent year-on-year growth with no decline across the study period, highlighting earnings stability.
* Profit CAGR of 9.96% indicates steady but slightly moderated profitability growth compared to revenue expansion.

### Margin Analysis

* Operating margins remained stable around ~25%, demonstrating strong operational efficiency and cost discipline despite scale expansion.
* Stable margin profile suggests a scalable delivery model typical of large-cap IT service firms.

### Cost Efficiency

* Expense ratios remained proportionate to revenue growth, indicating disciplined cost scaling and efficient operational management.

### Growth Quality

* Revenue CAGR exceeding profit CAGR suggests mature scalability with mild margin compression rather than profitability deterioration.
* YoY growth patterns highlight acceleration during the post-pandemic digital adoption phase followed by normalization.

### Revenue Growth Bridge (Waterfall Insight)

* Waterfall decomposition reveals that the strongest revenue expansion occurred during FY22–FY23, aligning with global digital acceleration trends.
* Later years show moderated growth, indicating industry normalization rather than structural weakness.



## Business Interpretation

From a financial analyst’s perspective, Infosys demonstrates characteristics of a high-quality compounder. The company combines predictable growth with stable margins and disciplined cost management. The absence of profit volatility and consistent EPS expansion indicate strong earnings visibility and shareholder value creation. These attributes are commonly associated with mature, well-governed large-cap IT firms that deliver steady long-term compounding rather than cyclical or hyper-growth patterns.



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining SQL-based financial analysis with Power BI visualization can transform raw financial data into actionable business insights. The structured approach enabled a comprehensive evaluation of Infosys’ growth trajectory, profitability stability, and earnings quality.

The analysis reveals that Infosys operates as a financially resilient and scalable enterprise with strong operational discipline and predictable performance. While revenue growth slightly outpaced profit growth, indicating mature scalability, overall financial health remains robust with stable margins and consistent shareholder value creation.

By integrating database analytics with executive-style dashboards, this project showcases practical skills relevant to financial analysis, business intelligence, and consulting roles. It highlights the ability to move beyond data extraction into insight generation and strategic interpretation — a key capability expected from modern finance and analytics professionals.

The analysis suggests that Infosys operates as a high-quality compounder with predictable growth, stable margins, and disciplined cost management. These characteristics are typical of mature large-cap IT firms with strong operational execution and long-term earnings visibility.
